## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

- Live Site URL: [News Homepage](luxuriant-meal.surge.sh)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

This was my first time using css grid. It took some figuring out but I'm happy with the end result. Youtube videos are a life saver!

I also learnt a bit more about bringing up the nav bar menu on top of the page on smaller screens by adding and removing classes with Javascript. Very useful stuff.

### Continued development

Although I'm happy with how the grid section came out, I'd like to continue working on my css grid skills and knowledge as it took me a long time to get things how I wanted them. I'd also ideally like to do more Javascript based projects to further improve my programming skills.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zBsdzdE4sM&t=304s) - I've watched this YouTube video 3 or 4 times now and learnt a lot about css grid from it. I would definitely recommend it.
